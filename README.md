# cvlib
A high level easy-to-use open source Computer Vision library for Python (v3.6).

## Installation

### Installing dependencies

Provided the below python packages are installed, cvlib is completely pip installable.

* OpenCV
* TensorFlow

If you don't have them already installed, you can install through pip

`pip install opencv-python tensorflow` 

#### Optional
or you can compile them from source if you want to enable optimizations for your specific hardware for better performance.
If you are working with GPU, you can install `tensorflow-gpu` package through `pip`. Make sure you have the necessary Nvidia drivers  installed preoperly (CUDA ToolKit, CuDNN etc). 

If you are not sure, just go with the cpu-only `tensorflow` package.

### Installing cvlib

`pip install cvlib`

To upgrade to the newest version
`pip install --upgrade cvlib`

#### Optional
If you want to build cvlib from source, clone this repository and run the below commands.
```
git clone https://github.com/arunponnusamy/cvlib.git
cd cvlib
python setup.py sdist
pip install .
```

**Note: Compatability with Python 2.x is not officially tested.**

## Face detection
Detecting faces in an image is as simple as just calling the function `detect_face()`. It will return the bounding box corners and corresponding confidence for all the faces detected.
### Example :

```
import cvlib as cv
faces, confidences = cv.detect_face(image)
```
Seriously, that's all it takes to do face detection with `cvlib`. Underneath it is using OpenCV's `dnn` module with a pre-trained caffemodel to detect faces.

Checkout `face_detection.py` in `examples` directory for the complete code.

### Sample output :

## Gender detection
Once face is detected, it can be passed on to `detect_gender()` function to recognize gender. It will return the labels (man, woman) and associated probabilities.

### Example

`label, confidence = cv.detect_gender(face) `

Underneath `cvlib` is using an AlexNet-like model trained on [Adience dataset](https://talhassner.github.io/home/projects/Adience/Adience-data.html#agegender) by Gil Levi and Tal Hassner for their [CVPR 2015 ](https://talhassner.github.io/home/publication/2015_CVPR) paper.

Checkout `gender_detection.py` in `examples` directory for the complete code.

### Sample output :

![](examples/images/gender_detection_output.jpg)

## Object detection
Detecting common objects in the scene is enabled through a single function call `detect_common_objects()`. It will return the bounding box co-ordinates, corrensponding labels and confidence scores for the detected objects in the image.

### Example :

```
import cvlib as cv
from cvlib.object_detection import draw_bbox

bbox, label, conf = cv.detect_common_objects(img)

output_image = draw_bbox(img, bbox, label, conf)
```
Underneath it uses [YOLOv3](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) model trained on [COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org/) capable of detecting 80 [common objects](https://github.com/arunponnusamy/object-detection-opencv/blob/master/yolov3.txt) in context.

Checkout `object_detection.py` in `examples` directory for the complete code.

### Real time object detection
`YOLOv3` is actually a heavy model to run on CPU. If you are working with real time webcam / video feed and doesn't have GPU, try using `tiny yolo` which is a smaller version of the original YOLO model. It's significantly fast but less accurate.

```
bbox, label, conf = cv.detect_common_objects(img, confidence=0.25, model='yolov3-tiny')
```
Check out the [example](examples/object_detection_webcam_yolov3_tiny.py) to learn more.

## Utils
### Video to frames
`get_frames( )` method can be helpful when you want to grab all the frames from a video. Just pass the path to the video, it will return all the frames in a list. Each frame in the list is a numpy array.
```
import cvlib as cv
frames = cv.get_frames('~/Downloads/demo.mp4')
```
Optionally you can pass in a directory path to save all the frames to disk.
```
frames = cv.get_frames('~/Downloads/demo.mp4', '~/Downloads/demo_frames/')
```

### Creating gif
`animate( )` method lets you create gif from a list of images. Just pass a list of images or path to a directory containing images and output gif name as arguments to the method, it will create a gif out of the images and save it to disk for you.

```
cv.animate(frames, '~/Documents/frames.gif')
```
